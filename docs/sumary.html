<h1>Summary &amp; Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Overview This lesson covered multiple definitions of research data and examined the varying types of research data including associated researcher materials that need to be included alongside data to ensure they remain meaningful. It also introduced learners to two key concepts examined in this course: metadata and the research data lifecycle. Understanding the heterogeneous nature of data can help researchers and information professionals appreciate how different disciplines conceptualize data. Building a familiarity with basic data management concepts will also enable researchers and information professionals to share a common vocabulary when discussing data management.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions Research data can take on many different forms, and definitions of research data can vary based on the research community.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health define research data as “Recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to document and support research findings” (National Institutes of Health).</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation’s definition describes data as something “determined by the community of interest through the process of peer review and program management” (National Science Foundation). Examples of data provided by NSF include data, publications, samples, physical collections, software, and models.</p>
<p>The National Endowment for the Humanities defines data as “materials generated or collected during the course of conducting research” and provides a wider variety of examples of data than NIH or NSF (National Endowment for the Humanities).</p>
<p>Key take-away: Data should be valid, shared, and are heterogeneous and contextualized within research communities.</p>
<p>There are other important research products that may need to be provided alongside the data in order for the data to be meaningful and to support secondary analysis. These may include codebooks, questionnaires, descriptions of methodologies, reports, conference posters, articles, white papers, websites or blogs, etc.</p>
<p>Metadata is defined as structured information that describes, explains, locates, and otherwise represents something else. Metadata allows data to be found and interpreted. At a minimum, one needs to know who created the data, when the data were created or published, and a title or descriptive name used to refer to the dataset. Digital data should also have a unique and persistent identifier. Two metadata standards commonly used to describe research data are Dublin Core and the Data Documentation Initiative.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Without supporting documentation and metadata, data may be rendered meaningless and unusable.</p>
<p>The research data lifecycle can be depicted in multiple different ways from simple to complex. It provides a useful way to think through the various different stages that data go through during a research project. Key phases of the research data lifecycle created by the Data Documentation Initiative include: Discovery and Planning, Initial Data Collection, Data Preparation and Analysis, Publication and Sharing, and Long-term Management.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Proper data management takes place across the entire research data lifecycle!</p>

<h1>Summary &amp; Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Overview This lesson defined the concept of “data management”, explained why data management is an important part of the responsible conduct of research, identified key stakeholders in data management and their roles and responsibilities, and illustrated how data management fits within the research lifecycle.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions Data management refers to the everyday handling and workflow of research data during the active phase of a project as well as the practices that support long-term preservation, access, and use after the project has been completed. These activities can include planning, documenting data, formatting data, storing data, anonymizing data, and controlling access to data.</p>
<p>Data Management, as defined by NOAA’s Administrative Order 212-15, “consists of two major activities conducted in coordination: data management services and data stewardship. They constitute a comprehensive end-to-end process including movement of data and information from the observing system sensors to the data user. This process includes the acquisition, quality control, metadata cataloging, validation, reprocessing, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and archival of data.”</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons why data management is important. It makes it possible for other researchers to discover, interpret, and reuse data. It helps sustain the value of data by enabling others to verify and build upon published results. It facilitates long-term preservation of and access to datasets. Finally, a growing number of funding agencies, journal publishers, and research institutions require it.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Data management is an integral part of the responsible conduct of research. It helps researchers optimize use of data during the active phase of the research project and helps them collaborate with other researchers.</p>
<p>Data management stakeholders may vary depending on the setting and subject domain but often include the following:</p>
<p>Primary Researcher or Principal Investigator: Creates and uses data</p>
<p>Institution: Sets internal data management policy</p>
<p>Data Repository: Curates and provides access to data</p>
<p>User: Uses 3rd party data</p>
<p>Funder: Provides the resources to support a research project</p>
<p>Publisher: Disseminates discoveries and maintains the scientific record</p>
<p>Key take-away: The variety of stakeholders suggests that proper management of data throughout the research lifecycle requires communication and cooperation between these various groups.</p>
<p>Data Management Across the Research Lifecycle Discovery &amp; Planning: This is the stage to determine if a project will produce a new dataset, combine existing datasets or analyze existing datasets; identify privacy, confidentiality, and other ethical issues; consider documentation format and content and the metadata standards to use to describe the data; identify potential users of project data; identify an appropriate data repository to archive the data; and determine data management costs. These details should be included in the data management plan.</p>
<p>Initial Data Collection: This is the stage during which to determine workflows and procedures for organizing files, backups and storage, performing quality assurance protocols, and setting appropriate access controls and security measures.</p>
<p>Preparation &amp; Data Analysis: Researchers may need to clean, manipulate, or process the raw data. What is important during this stage is to document the changes to the raw data and creating a “master” version to be analyzed and eventually archived. It is also essential to document analysis procedures such as additional modifications to the data, the model used, the code used to run the analysis, and hardware and software specifications.</p>
<p>Publication and Sharing: This is the stage to consult with the archive or repository to determine file formats, clean and further document data. Additionally, all documentation should be reviewed to ensure that the they contain enough information to allow the data to be re-used by a third party.</p>
<p>Long-term Management: This is the stage during which researchers share their data and findings through publications, submit reports, and deposit data and supplementary materials into the archive or repository.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Effective data management takes place during all phases of the research lifecycle from planning your project to collecting your data to preparing and analyzing your data and then finally publishing and sharing your data in a repository that will see to their long term management.</p>

<h1>Summary &amp; Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Overview This lesson provided a basic overview of Data Management Plans. Most funding agencies now require grantees to submit Data Management Plans as a part of the grant proposal package. Therefore, it is important for researchers as well as information professionals supporting researchers to understand how to create a DMP. This lesson also discussed available DMP tools that can assist researchers and information professionals in the development of comprehensive DMPs.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions Data Management Plans (otherwise known as DMPs) are formal documents that describe the data produced during a research project and outline data management strategies that will be implemented during and after the active phase of the research project. DMPs also describe in detail all aspects of data management that will take place during the entire research data lifecycle when data are being collected, organized, documented, shared, and preserved.</p>
<p>A growing number of funding agencies including the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the Wellcome Trust require researchers to submit Data Management Plans. Funding agencies require grantees to submit Data Management Plans because they provide assurances that data will be accessible and usable over the long term. This is important for two primary reasons:</p>
<p>Data Management Plans support transparency and openness. Data management plans that illustrate how data will be made discoverable, accessible, and reusable support the responsibility to make publicly funded research products openly available.</p>
<p>Data Management Plans support return on investment. Making data discoverable, accessible, and reusable maximizes the research potential of the data and provides greater returns on public investments in research.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Today, DMPs are required by a growing number of funding agencies. Two key reasons why funders require DMPs is to support transparency and openness and their return on investment.</p>
<p>The Digital Curation Centre’s Checklist for a Data Management Plan provides a useful list of questions to consider when writing a DMP:</p>
<p>What data will you collect or create?</p>
<p>How will the data be collected or created?</p>
<p>What documentation and metadata will accompany the data?</p>
<p>How will you manage any ethical issues?</p>
<p>How will you manage copyright and intellectual property rights issues?</p>
<p>How will the data be stored and backed up during research?</p>
<p>How will you manage access and security?</p>
<p>Which data should be retained, shared, and/or preserved?</p>
<p>What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset?</p>
<p>How will you share the data?</p>
<p>Are any restrictions on data sharing required?</p>
<p>Who will be responsible for data management?</p>
<p>What resources will you require to implement your plan?</p>
<p>Key take-away: Writing a DMP helps researchers think through data management issues early in the research lifecycle, which can help researchers “do better research” and ensure that data will remain accessible and usable over the long-term.</p>
<p>Two helpful (and free!) data management planning tools available to researchers and information professionals include the DMPTool, created by the University of California Curation Center of the California Digital Library, and DMPOnline, developed by the UK Digital Curation Centre. Both of these tools provide guidance and templates for creating Data Management Plans in compliance with institutional and funder requirements. For more information on these tools check out the following videos:</p>
<p>DMPTool Overview Video: https://dmptool.org/video</p>
<p>DMPOnline Video: http://www.screenr.com/PJHN</p>
<p>Key take-away: You are not alone! There are numerous free, online tools available to help researchers and information professionals create Data Management Plans.</p>

<p>Overview In this lesson (module) you were introduced to the concepts of research data organisation or housekeeping: what constitutes good data file management; the importance of managing data; file versioning, naming and re-naming conventions.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions Research data files and folders need to be labelled and organised in a systematic way so that they are both identifiable and accessible for current and future users.</p>
<p>Naming files according to agreed conventions should make file naming easier for you as well as for others because there will be no need to ‘re-think’ the process each time.</p>
<p>Another benefit of consistent research data file labelling is that files are not accidentally overwritten or deleted.</p>
<p>It is important to consistently identify and distinguish versions of research data files as well. This ensures that a clear audit trail exists for tracking the development of a data file and identifying earlier versions when needed.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Whatever you do, be consistent throughout the process.</p>

<h1>Summary &amp; Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Overview In this module you were introduced to concepts of data file formatting, compression, normalisation, and other kinds of data transformation and why they are useful and important.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions If you need to convert or migrate your data files from one format to another, you need to be aware of the potential risk of the loss or corruption of your data and take appropriate steps to avoid/minimise it.</p>
<p>When compressing your data files for the purpose of storage, transportation or transmission, you encode the information using fewer bits than the original representation. Commonly used compression programs are, zip, GNU Zip (.gzip or .tar.gz) and Stuffit.</p>
<p>In your research you may also use the process of data normalisation; two meanings of this that may be of relevance to you are statistical normalisation and database normalisation.</p>
<p>You may also need to compute new values from old in your data, a process which is called data transformation, which may also be a necessary prelude to analysing your data. Three techniques which could be classified as data transformation are aggregation (combining data into larger units), anonymization (removing information identifying human subjects) and perturbation (distortion).</p>
<p>Key take-away: If you are saving files with proprietary formats for the long-term, consider creating a plain text or open format version to save along with them.</p>

<h1>Summary &amp; Additional Resources</h1>
<p>Overview In this lesson you were introduced to the importance of documenting your research data, and why and how to cite data.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions There are many reasons why you need to document your data:</p>
<p>to help you remember the details later</p>
<p>to help others understand your research, verify your findings, review your submitted publication, replicate your results, or even archive your data for access and re-use.</p>
<p>Research data need to be documented at various levels:</p>
<p>project level</p>
<p>file or database level</p>
<p>and variable or item level.</p>
<p>Some examples of data documentation are:</p>
<p>laboratory notebooks</p>
<p>methodology reports</p>
<p>questionnaires</p>
<p>and software syntax.</p>
<p>Laboratory notebooks, for example, play an important role in supporting claims relating to intellectual property developed by researchers, and even defending against claims of scientific fraud.</p>
<p>Data citation promotes the reproduction of research results, allows the impact and use of data to be tracked, and provides a structure which recognises and rewards the data creator.</p>
<p>Key take-away: By providing good documentation and a citation for your work, you make it easier for others to re-use your data, cite your work, and give you acknowledgement in the scholarly record. When re-using others’ data you should give it a proper citation as well.</p>

<p>Overview In this lesson you were introduced to issues involved in storing, securing and backing up your research data, the importance of data backups, options available to you to safely store your data, password safety guidelines, and how to encrypt and destroy sensitive data when required.</p>
<p>Key Concepts &amp; Definitions In this module you were introduced to issues involved in storing, securing and backing up your research data, the importance of data backups, options available to you to safely store your data, password safety guidelines, and how to encrypt and destroy sensitive data when required.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of your research you must ensure that you store your research data in a secure way and have backup copies in at least three locations that are maintained regularly. The recommended storage is your institution’s networked drive. Personal computers and laptops should not be used for storing master copies of data, and external storage devices are not recommended for the long term storage of data, particularly master copies.</p>
<p>Securing research data is an important aspect of information technology security. You should always have up-to-date anti-virus software installed on your office and home computers, encrypt highly-sensitive electronic data and store paper records in a locked room or safe.</p>
<p>Once research using sensitive data no longer requires that the identifiable portions of the data be retained, they should be destroyed and future research be done with de-identified or anonymised data. This applies to paper records, as well as electronic records.</p>
<p>Remember that your passwords are the most common way to prove your identity when using websites, email accounts and your computer itself (via User Accounts). Therefore, always use a strong password, never disclose your password to anyone else. Make your password something you can remember but difficult for others to guess.</p>
<p>Key take-away: Don’t be the next sob story about data loss. Take precautions up front so you will not have regrets later. Know how your data are backed up.</p>
